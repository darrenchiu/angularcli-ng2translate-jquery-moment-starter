# angularcli-ng2translate-jquery-moment-starter

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.19-3.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


## Why a seperate repo?

This is mostly for my self-use purpose. But considering there are quite some people confused about setting up jquery, moment and other non-typed JS libs with Angular2.
I18n is a major concern for a lot of asian developers as well, so I have setup the starter with ng2-translate.
