## Why a seperate repo?

This is mostly for my self-use purpose. But considering there are quite some people confused about setting up jquery, moment and other non-typed JS libs with Angular2, I decided to put this in GitHub.
I18n is a major concern for a lot of asian developers as well, so I have setup the starter with ng2-translate as well.
